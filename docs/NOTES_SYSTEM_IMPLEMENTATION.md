# Notes System Implementation

## Overview

This document outlines the complete backend implementation for the notes upload and management system, including database schema, API endpoints, and frontend integration.

## Components Implemented

### 1. Database Schema (`supabase/migrations/011_notes_system.sql`)

- **Notes table**: Core note storage with metadata
- **Note likes table**: User likes/reactions
- **Note comments table**: Comments system (basic structure)
- **Note downloads table**: Download tracking
- **Storage bucket**: File storage for PDFs
- **RLS policies**: Row-level security for data access
- **Database functions**: Search, view counting, statistics

### 2. API Endpoints

#### POST/GET `/api/notes`

- **POST**: Upload new notes (PDF or text)
- **GET**: Search and filter notes with pagination
- Features:
  - File upload to Supabase Storage
  - Metadata validation
  - Automatic point rewards (gamification)
  - Search with filters (subject, academic level, etc.)

#### GET/PUT/DELETE `/api/notes/[id]`

- **GET**: Retrieve single note with view counting
- **PUT**: Update note (owner only)
- **DELETE**: Delete note and associated files (owner only)

#### POST `/api/notes/[id]/actions`

- **Like/unlike notes**: Toggle like status
- **Download tracking**: Log downloads and provide URLs

### 3. Frontend Components

#### Upload System (`app/(protected-routes)/dashboard/notes/upload/page.tsx`)

- Dual mode: PDF upload or rich text editor
- Comprehensive form with academic metadata
- Real-time validation
- File upload with progress indication
- Form auto-population from file names

#### Notes Browser (`components/notes/kawanstudy-note.tsx`)

- Search and filter interface
- Pagination with load more
- Real-time data from API
- Responsive grid layout

#### Note Details (`app/(protected-routes)/dashboard/notes/[id]/page.tsx`)

- Full note display with metadata
- Like/download functionality
- Author information
- Tags and categorization
- PDF viewer integration

#### Note Cards (`components/notes/note-card.tsx`)

- Compact note display
- Statistics (views, likes, downloads)
- Tag display
- Author attribution

### 4. Services and Utilities

#### Notes Service (`lib/services/notes.ts`)

- Centralized API communication
- Error handling
- Type-safe operations
- File upload management

#### Custom Hooks (`hooks/use-notes.ts`)

- Reusable note operations
- Error handling
- User feedback integration

#### Validation (`lib/validations/note-form.ts`)

- Zod schema validation
- Form data type safety
- File validation rules

## Database Schema Details

### Notes Table Fields

```sql
- id: UUID primary key
- user_id: Foreign key to profiles
- title, description: Basic content
- content: Rich text for text-based notes
- content_type: 'pdf' | 'text'
- subject, topic, academic_level: Academic classification
- tags: Array of strings for categorization
- note_type: Classification (lecture-notes, summary, etc.)
- visibility: public | friends-only | private
- file_name, file_size, file_url, file_path: File metadata
- view_count, download_count, like_count: Statistics
- status: draft | pending | published | rejected
- timestamps: created_at, updated_at
```

### Security Features

- Row Level Security (RLS) enabled
- Users can only edit their own notes
- Public notes viewable by everyone
- Private notes accessible to owners only
- File access controlled through storage policies

## API Usage Examples

### Upload a Note

```javascript
const formData = new FormData();
formData.append("title", "My Note");
formData.append("subject", "Mathematics");
formData.append("file", pdfFile);

const response = await fetch("/api/notes", {
  method: "POST",
  body: formData,
});
```

### Search Notes

```javascript
const response = await fetch(
  "/api/notes?search=calculus&subject=Mathematics&page=1"
);
const { notes, total, hasMore } = await response.json();
```

### Like a Note

```javascript
const response = await fetch(`/api/notes/${noteId}/actions`, {
  method: "POST",
  headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
  body: JSON.stringify({ action: "like" }),
});
```

## Integration Points

### Gamification System

- Points awarded for note uploads (25 points)
- Activity logging for statistics
- Achievement potential for content creation

### Notification System

- Can be extended for like notifications
- Comment notifications (when implemented)
- Download notifications for authors

### Profile System

- Author attribution
- User statistics integration
- Avatar display in note cards

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features

1. **Comments System**: Full implementation with threading
2. **PDF Text Extraction**: OCR for searchable content
3. **Note Collaboration**: Shared editing and contributions
4. **Advanced Search**: Full-text search in PDF content
5. **Categories**: Hierarchical organization
6. **Bookmarks**: Save favorite notes
7. **Reports**: Content moderation system

### Technical Improvements

1. **Caching**: Redis for frequently accessed content
2. **CDN**: Content delivery optimization
3. **Search**: Elasticsearch integration
4. **Analytics**: Usage tracking and insights
5. **Mobile**: React Native app integration

## Testing

### Test Upload Flow

1. Navigate to `/dashboard/notes/upload`
2. Fill required fields (title, subject, academic level)
3. Upload PDF or enter text content
4. Submit and verify database entry
5. Check file storage in Supabase

### Test Browse Flow

1. Navigate to `/dashboard/notes`
2. Use search and filters
3. Click on note cards
4. Verify note detail page
5. Test like and download actions

## Environment Variables Required

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```

## Database Setup

1. Run migration: `npx supabase db reset`
2. Verify tables created in Supabase dashboard
3. Check storage bucket 'notes' exists
4. Test RLS policies with different user accounts

## Deployment Checklist
